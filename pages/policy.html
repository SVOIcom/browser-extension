            </p>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Everscale Wallet is a blockchain communicator. It can act as a Everscale operating system (&quot;Everscale OS&quot;) user environment as it supports an end-to-end decentralization (E2ED) framework.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Please carefully read this Policy to understand the definitions of Everscale Wallet, Everscale Blockchain, Everscale, Everscale OS, E2ED and DApps, including Everscale Wallet&#39;s personal data processing guidelines.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c1">This Policy can be published in different languages for localization purposes, but in case of any discrepancies between the English version and the version in a language other than English, the English version shall always prevail.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Use of Everscale Wallet</span></p>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c1">As a user of the Services you have a limited, personal, non-commercial, non-exclusive, non-transferable, and a potentially revocable license to use Everscale Wallet. Everscale Wallet users are required to follow some basic rules, including, but not limited to, never using Everscale Wallet for illegal purposes. You further agree to comply with any and all applicable laws and regulations when using Everscale Wallet. This includes any local, provincial, state, federal, national, or international laws that may apply to you.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c1">You agree that you shall not use the Services to pay for, support, or otherwise engage in any illegal activities, including but not limited to, illegal gambling, fraud, money laundering, or terrorist activities.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c1">You further agree not to encourage or induce any third party to engage in any of the aforementioned activities as prohibited under this section.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Everscale Blockchain is a departure from usual blockchain designs. It is your responsibility to learn and understand how Everscale Blockchain operates in order to protect your digital assets and safely navigate through the various and diverse features of Everscale (The Open Network).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Everscale Blockchain is designed on Everscale technology.</span></p>
            <p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Unlike other blockchains, Everscale associates all wallet addresses with a computer code. For purposes of this Policy, this code will be referred to as a &quot;Smart Contract&quot;. Please remember that every transaction is an execution of a Smart Contract code by the blockchain. In this sense, Everscale Blockchain is more of a distributed computer than a record keeper.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Everscale utilizes several native cryptocurrencies or Everscale currencies. Collectively they are the Currency Collection. The base cryptocurrency of the Everscale Blockchain is the &quot;Everscale Crystal&quot; or the &quot;Everscale&quot; that is necessary to operate since it is used to charge Gas fees as described below.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c1">All Everscale interactions send and receive Messages. For example, to send someone digital assets you need to create a message, sign it with your cryptographic key(s), and then send it to a Smart Contract that holds those digital assets. This Smart Contract executes the instructions dictated in the Message and transfers coins to another smart contract. Everything in Everscale is based on interactions between Smart Contracts.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c1">A familiar and important type of Smart Contract is a Wallet. Unlike other blockchains, the Wallet is not the software on your phone or a computer that holds your cryptographic keys. Everscale Wallet is a Smart Contract stored and executed on the blockchain, by the blockchain, and in accordance with the instructions you send along with the Message.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c1">It is critical to understand that Everscale Wallet IS NOT a Wallet. Everscale Wallet is client software that facilitates your interaction with Everscale blockchain by helping you do the following:</span>
            </p>
            <p class="c2"><span
                    class="c1">- Safely create and manage Secret Keys (described below) on your device</span></p>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c1">- Deploy your Smart Contracts, including your Wallet Smart Contract</span>
            </p>
            <p class="c2"><span
                    class="c1">- Interact with Everscale Smart Contracts by creating, signing and sending Messages</span></p>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c1">- Interact with Decentralized Applications (DApps)</span></p>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c1">- Review and analyze events in Everscale blockchain</span></p>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c1">- Interaction with some of your system resources when necessary (such as access to camera when reading a QR code for example)</span>
            </p>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c1">- Provide other services</span></p>
            <p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c1">By using Everscale Wallet you acknowledge and agree that Everscale Wallet DOES NOT STORE OR TRANSMIT DIGITAL ASSETS. Everscale Wallet only transmits Messages. Any transfer involving any digital asset occurs on Everscale blockchain and not in any network owned by Everscale Wallet or any of its affiliated companies. We do not guarantee that Everscale Wallet can affect the transfer of title or right in any digital asset(s).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Once you submit a message via Everscale Wallet it cannot be cancelled or otherwise modified. You must be certain that the Smart Contract associated with any transaction has enough digital assets to cover all necessary fees associated with the transaction prior to executing it. You acknowledge and agree that Everscale Wallet and any of its affiliates shall not be held liable for any failed transactions.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Secret Keys. Master Password</span></p>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Secret or private keys are crucial to your operations with regard to Everscale blockchain. They are used to sign Messages that interact with Smart Contracts in Everscale. THESE KEYS PROTECT ALL OF YOUR Everscale DIGITAL ASSETS.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c1">To use Everscale Walletyou must either import or create a private key. Creation of your private key is executed through the open source Everscale Labs SDK located only on your device and likewise stored only on that device.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Everscale Wallet cannot hold, store, or recover your key(s). Everscale Wallet has no way to recover your key(s) if you lose it/them.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c1">You bear full responsibility for storing your private keys, keystore files, and any mnemonic (backup) phrase associated with those keys in a safe place where you can recover them; otherwise, you risk losing control over any and all digital assets that are associated with those private keys, forever.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Everscale Wallet has no means to help you recover your password or secret key: Everscale Wallet DOES NOT HAVE THEM!</span>
            </p>
            <p class="c2"><span
                    class="c1">All users, especially those with high value wallet balances, are highly encouraged to:</span>
            </p>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Securely backup your seed phrase or keystore file and password for it in multiple places. Keys are a complex sequence of symbols. DO NOT try to write these down &quot;as-is&quot;. You risk making a mistake and losing all of your digital assets.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Notify us of any irregular activity that you may encounter during your Everscale Wallet.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">User Identity</span></p>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Everscale Wallet does not identify you or your device. You acknowledge and agree that information associated with your Everscale Wallet identity can be lost and Everscale Wallet may not be able to restore it. Since Everscale Wallet does not have your private keys we will not be able to decrypt any data associated with your security keys.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c1">If you use third party services such as those obtained through buying or selling digital assets in exchange for fiat currency, any such third-party service provider may request your personal information or other information via Everscale Wallet. In such cases you are responsible for reviewing their terms and conditions before accepting them. Everscale Wallet shall assume no liability for your usage of any third-party services.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Third party services may not be genuinely decentralized; therefore, using any third-party services may expose you to identity disclosure that is out of the control of Everscale Wallet, or any of its affiliated companies. Bear in mind that using these services may require:</span>
            </p>
            <p class="c2"><span
                    class="c1">Linking your real identity with your digital assets and Smart Contracts</span></p>

            <p class="c2"><span class="c1">You hereby agree and consent to not hold Everscale Wallet liable for any risks or losses associated with your use of any such third-party services.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c1">By using Everscale Wallet you agree that Everscale Wallet is only an interface to Everscale Blockchain, that, as mentioned above, consists of Smart Contracts. Everscale Wallet neither controls nor determines content, function, or execution of those Smart Contracts. You acknowledge and agree that you shall assume all responsibility for interaction with Smart Contracts.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">Smart Contracts</span></p>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Smart Contacts are computer programs that are executed on the blockchain and verified by its consensus protocol to perform a so called verifiable computation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c1">As explained above, Everscale Wallet is a Smart Contract client. In that sense, any true Everscale software is a smart contract client. Everscale Wallet can manage any Everscale Smart Contract and interact with it, provided that it has a special declaration file, or the so-called Everscale ABI (Everscale Application Binary Interface). The Everscale ABI version that Everscale Wallet supports is covered in Everscale Labs&#39; official documentation available at ton.dev .</span>
            </p>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c1">By default, Everscale Wallet deploys an ad hoc wallet smart contract from TON Labs (the &quot;Multi-signature Wallet Smart Contract&quot;). This Smart Contract is the first ever formally verified Everscale contract. Formal verification is a way to prove correct execution of a computer code.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Despite the above, no verification can prove and ensure 100% accuracy of software, and even if it were possible to do so, we cannot guarantee such accuracy.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="c2 c3"><span class="c1"></span></p>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c0">DApps</span></p>
            <p class="c2"><span class="c1">Decentralized applications (DApps) are third-party computer application. Everscale Wallet neither controls nor determines content, function, or execution of DApps scripts or the corresponding Smart Contracts. Given that a DApps is a decentralized way to interact with a Smart Contract, everything that applies to Smart Contracts in this Policy likewise applies to DApps.</span>

We strongly encourage you to review your transaction details carefully before attempting to transfer digital assets.</span>
